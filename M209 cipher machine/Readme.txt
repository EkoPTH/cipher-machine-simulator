 1. Description
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 This program is an exact simulation of the M-209 Cipher Machine,
 used by the US Military during and after the Second World War.
 The M-209 was the American version of the C-38, designed by the
 Swedish cryptographer Boris Hagelin. It had the size of a lunchbox
 and presented a brilliant design of mechanics.

 This simulator, fully compatible with the original cipher machine,
 enables realistic operation with rotating code wheels, setting of
 wheel pins and drum lugs, combined with authentic graphics.
 An Autotyping function and a formatted clipboard and make it easy
 to enter enter and copy ciphertext and paintext. The program comes
 with a very complete helpfile, containing the manual, the US
 military enciphering procedures and all technica details on the
 machine. With this program you will be able to work with the M-209
 and examine how it works and how it was operated. This is simulator
 is a true reference to the M-209.
