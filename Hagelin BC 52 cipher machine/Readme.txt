 1. Description
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 This program is an accurate simulation of the Hagelin BC-52. After
 the success of the C-38 and M-209 as tactical cipher devices,
 Hagelin developed a cipher machine for high level military and
 diplomatic encryption. In 1952 the C-52 was introduced and, as
 Devours and Kruh wrote, 'caused ripples throughout the cryptanalytic
 community'. The C-52 raised the security of drum-and-lug devices to
 another level. The machine had 6 irregular moving pinwheels,
 selected from a set of 12, and the number of drum bars was extended
 to 32, of which 5 where also used to advance the wheels. When lugs
 and pins are selected carefully the C-52 provides even in this
 computer era a powerful encryption. The combination of C-52 and the
 keyboard, denoted B-52, was named BC-52. Within short time the BC-52
 was purchased by more than 60 countries and remaind popular until
 today.
